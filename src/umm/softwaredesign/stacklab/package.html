<p>
Contains an interface and implementation of a basic stack class. Used in
lab exercises in the University of Minnesota, Morris, CSci 3601
(Software Design and Development) course.
</p>

<p>
The <code>test</code> directory contains a suite of specifications written
	using the <link href="http://spockframework.org/" title="Spock homepage">Spock specification framework</a> 
	that defines the expected behavior of the <code>Stack</code> class. When you get that suite
	of specifications to pass, then you probably have a pretty reasonable implementation of
	of the <code>Stack</code> class, although it's always possible that there can
	be errors that aren't caught by these specifications, so don't just assume that
	your implementation is completely correct just because the tests pass 
</p>

<h2>Package Specification</h2>

<ul>
	<li><code>StackIF</code> is the interface that defines what a
	stack should be.</li>
	<li><code>Stack</code> should (eventually) become a complete
	implementation of that interface.</li>
	<li><code>StackUnderflowException</code> is a runtime exception
	that is thrown when a stack underflows, i.e., when we pop or top an
	empty stack.</li>
</ul>
